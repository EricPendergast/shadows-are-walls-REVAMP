TODOs:

✓1. Make ShadowHitting objects always resolve to light areas
✓2. Calculate shadow islands
✓3. Handle case where an object is fully illuminated by a light (make it not generate any shadow islands)
4. Create edge triangle manifolds
5. Convert certain corner manifolds into edge constraints
6. Remove old edge manifold stuff
7. Implement corner-box constraints
8. Convert certain corner manifolds into corner-box constraints
9. Implement corner-edge constraints
10. Convert certain corner manifolds into corner-edge constraints
11. Fix problems with partial shadow edges

2. Make ShadowHitting objects choose to always resolve to light areas or dark areas.
3. Allow for overlapping shadow edges
