Multi contacts tasks:
    1. Compute edge mounts

How to handle ids:
    The id of a shadow edge contact should encompass:
        1. The id of the casting object
        2. The id of where the edge is mounted on the casting object
        3. The id of the ShadowHitting object
        4. The id of where the edge is hitting the ShadowHitting object

    Notice that the shadow edge itself does not have an id.
    (1) and (2) will be encompassed by EdgeMount.id
