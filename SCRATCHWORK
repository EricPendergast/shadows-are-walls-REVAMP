How to implement swappable detector
It is a trigger box which registers contacts that should follow the player.
It is referenced by PlayerRoot

Behavior is similar to the pullable detector.
Pullable detector is a different shape.
It is referenced by something common to root and branch players

If I implemented these with a generic Follower component, then it wouldn't be
clear exactly when in the frame they are supposed to follow.
