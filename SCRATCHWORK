Jacobian debugger:
    How can I represent the Jacobian in an understandable way? 
    Idea 1: Show the result of position correction
        Have bias and t on sliders from 0 to 1
        For each constraint,
            constraint.bias = bias
            Velocity vel = 0;
            constraint.ApplyImpulse(vel);
            draw elements at time t with position pos + vel*t
